1. use environment.yml to build envirnoment
2. inference.py and inference.sh to inference Rnamigos2
Here I provided 9cpd as example, for do_inference in inference.sh:
```
do_inference(
        cif_path=cif_path,
        residue_list=residue_list_all.split(","),
        ligands_path=ligands_path,
        out_path=out_path_all,
        dump_all=True,
    )
```
* where cif_path is path to 9cpd.cif, ligands_path is path to SMILES ligands list.
* The input of residue_list can get by get_residue_list function in inference.sh which will get all the residues in the graph of 9cpd.cif
3. After inference, use read_score_9cpd.ipynb to read scores and ranks
